The todoapp.pickle file will be created when a user saves his/her list. There is currently no existing pickle file. A blank list will appear instead. If there is a saved list, it will be opened when the .py file is run. The user also has the open to open the saved file by clicking the appropriate link. The user can choose to clear the list and generate the saved list. Saving a list will overwrite the existing pickle file, if there is one.
